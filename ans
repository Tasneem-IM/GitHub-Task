Q1:Explain the purpose of the following Git commands:

git status:Shows the status of files
git init:initializes a new Git repository
git commit: save staged changes with a message
git push:Pushes changes from your local pc to GitHub
----------------------------------------------------
Q2:Ahmed claims that there is no need for the command, and it is better to commit changes directly from the working directory.
whether you agree or disagree with Ahmed's statement. Provide reasons to support your answer?

I disagree with Ahmed, because skipping Git commands like git add reduces control over what gets committed, and Using each Git command properly
ensures organized commits, avoids mistakes, and supports better teamwork and version tracking.
-----------------------------------------------------
Q3:List two popular code hosting platforms besides GitHub.

GitLab / Bitbucket 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Q4:What key features do code hosting providers offer to enhance version control for both individual developers and collaborative development environments?

Remote repositories to store and access code from anywhere
Collaboration tools (pull requests, code reviews, comments)
Branching and merging support for team workflows
Issue tracking to manage bugs and tasks
Continuous Integration (CI/CD) to automate testing and deployment
Access control and permissions for secure collaboration
-----------------------------------------------------------
Q5:True or False: A team can collaborate on a software project without relying on popular code hosting providers by setting up their own a self-hosted server for version control.

True 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6:What does the flag in the command signify, and how does it impact the behavior of the git push and git pull commands in subsequent usage?

links local branch to a remote branch, allowing to use simpler `git push` and `git pull` commands without specifying the remote or branch each time.
